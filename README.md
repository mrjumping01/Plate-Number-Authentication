# Plate-Number-Authentication
The aim of this project is to detect and read car plate numbers from a live camera feed as a form of authentication. All code is in Python, and out go-to library is OpenCV. 
In order to train my model, most images of my dataset are from Roboflow Universe, click [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/car-plate-number-detection/alphanumeric-character-detection) to access it.
